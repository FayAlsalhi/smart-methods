# ðŸ”˜ Arduino - 3 LEDs with 3 Push Buttons

This is a simple Arduino project created using **Tinkercad Circuits**.  
It demonstrates how to control **3 LEDs** using **3 individual push buttons**.

Each button lights up its corresponding LED for 3 seconds when pressed.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Idea

- 3 push buttons are connected to digital pins 7, 4, and 2.
- 3 LEDs are connected to digital pins 13, 12, and 8.
- When a button is pressed, the corresponding LED turns on for 3 seconds, then turns off.

This project is great for beginners to learn about:
- Digital inputs (buttons)
- Digital outputs (LEDs)
- Basic Arduino programming
