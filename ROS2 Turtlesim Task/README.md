# 🐢 ROS2 Turtlesim Simulation

This project demonstrates how to use the `turtlesim` package in **ROS2** to control a turtle using keyboard commands.

> 📌 **Task**: Manipulate the turtlesim package in ROS2  
> 📁 **Goal**: Upload all steps and screenshots on GitHub

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Step 1: Launch the Turtlesim Node

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
✅ Step 2: Control the Turtle
Open a second terminal and run the teleop (keyboard control) node:

bash
نسخ
تحرير
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
You should see instructions like:

Use arrow keys to move the turtle.

Use G B V C D E R T to rotate.

Press F to cancel rotation.

Press Q to quit.

⚠️ Important: Click on the terminal window before using the keyboard — not the turtle screen.

📝 Notes
Make sure both terminals are in the same ROS2 environment.

If the turtle doesn't move, focus on the terminal running turtle_teleop_key.
