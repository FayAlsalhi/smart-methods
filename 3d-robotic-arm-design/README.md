<img width="1004" height="489" alt="Shiny Snaget-Gaaris" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cc9cd6c-9ae5-4f9d-a89d-cfbd20ea8d3a" />

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents a **3D robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (5DOF)**, fully designed using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). The arm demonstrates basic mechanical movement simulation and is intended for educational and prototyping purposes.

It consists of:
- A rotating base
- Shoulder joint
- Elbow joint
- Wrist pitch
- Wrist rotation
- Simple functional gripper

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Practice 3D mechanical modeling in Tinkercad  
- Understand the structure and articulation of robotic arms  
- Visualize how degrees of freedom impact range of motion  
- Prepare for real-world robotics projects (e.g., servo-controlled models)

## ðŸ›  Tools & Platform
- **Tinkercad 3D Design**  
- Browser-based platform (no installation needed)

## ðŸ”§ Design Structure

| Component         | Functionality            |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Base             | Enables arm rotation     |
| Shoulder Joint   | Allows upward motion     |
| Elbow Joint      | Adds middle flexibility  |
| Wrist Pitch      | Moves the gripper up/down|
| Wrist Rotation   | Spins gripper horizontally|
| Gripper          | Picks up objects         |

## ðŸ“š Notes
This design is purely mechanical and intended for conceptual learning. For actual movement, it can be extended using Arduino and servo motors in the Tinkercad Circuits environment or real hardware.
