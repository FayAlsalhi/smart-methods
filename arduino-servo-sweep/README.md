# Arduino Servo Sweep ðŸš€

A simple yet effective Arduino project that demonstrates **servo motor movement using the Servo library**.  
The motor continuously sweeps back and forth from 0Â° to 180Â°, simulating a basic motion system that can be extended for robotics, automation, or interactive hardware demos.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project shows how to control a servo motor using an Arduino Uno.  
The servo gradually moves between two angles (0Â° â†’ 180Â° â†’ 0Â°) in a smooth loop.  
This kind of movement is foundational in robotics and mechanical systems like:
- Arm joints
- Sensor scanners
- Automatic doors
- Gimbals

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Learn how to control servo motors using Arduino
- Use `for` loops to control smooth motion
- Practice using the `Servo.h` library

## ðŸ§° Required Components

| Component       | Quantity |
|----------------|----------|
| Arduino Uno     | 1        |
| Servo Motor (SG90 or similar) | 1        |
| Jumper Wires    | 3        |
| Breadboard (optional) | 1        |
| USB Cable       | 1        |
| Computer w/ Arduino IDE | 1        |

---

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Connection

| Servo Pin | Connects To      |
|-----------|------------------|
| Red       | 5V (Power)       |
| Brown/Black | GND (Ground)   |
| Orange/Yellow | Digital Pin 9 |

You can use a breadboard or direct jumper wiring. External power is not required for a single small servo.
